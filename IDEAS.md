# IDEAS

- Spectator mode for live games: Allow users to join any ongoing game as a spectator and watch the gameplay in real time.
- Game replay system: Save and replay previous games with step-by-step analysis and move highlighting. 
- Daily Challenge Mode: Each day, generate a unique puzzle or scenario for each game. Players can attempt the daily challenge and compare their results on a leaderboard.
- **AI Training Mode**: Implement a learning system where players can train the AI by playing against it and providing feedback on move quality. The AI could adapt its strategy based on player preferences and playing style, creating a personalized opponent that gets better over time.
